Their formation and evolution are still debated questions in the extragalactic community. I use observational data (UV, optical) of LSBs, in combination with galaxy evolution models to constrain their properties (e.g., star formation, environmental interactions). During my postdoc at NCBJ, I am working with the ASTROdust group (led by Katarzyna Ma≈Çek) to characterize the dust attenuation in a large sample of galaxies observed by Herschel. I am also an active member of the LSST Galaxies Science Collaboration, with a special focus on low surface brightness science.</p> </body></html>
